### üìÑ Available Templates

**View + ViewModel (Extension in Same File)**  
Creates an empty SwiftUI view with a `ViewModel` class defined as an extension within the same file.

**View + ViewModel (Separate File)**  
Creates an empty SwiftUI view and a `ViewModel` class in its own separate file.

**Credentials Form**  
Creates a simple login form with fields for email and password. Includes basic error message handling.

**SecretsHandler**
